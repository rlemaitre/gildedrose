# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/#!/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases.

Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design.

## Better Code Hub

I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!
